  <h2>2017-2020 Assistant Manager at <img src="asset/picture/GSECic.png"></h2>
  <h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>
    <p>From March 2017 to December 2019, I worked as an Assistant Manager at the subcontract management team at 
        GS Engineering & Construction Ho Chi Minh City Head Office.</p>
  <h4>Subcontract Management <i class="fas fa-address-book"></i></h4>
    <p>I served as the primary point of contract and liaison between contractors and various project teams of GS E&C.  My duties were to build effective relationships with key stakeholders, vendors, and subcontractors. Also, I managed and administered contract agreements, manage the access and permissions within platforms and tools related to subcontracting bids. During my service period, I proposed and built new processes to assess and improve the contactor onboarding experience, including developing a subcontractor assessment framework and implementing further efficiencies, improvements, and updates. I monitored and evaluated contractor performance, organized, maintained, and tracked all contracts and related documents electronically. I became the in-house expert on the contractor engagement management platform, address related questions, and trained employees and contractors to effectively and efficiently use the in-house subcontract management platform.</p>
    <h4>Bidding Management <i class="fas fa-file-signature"></i></h4>
    <p>I worked closely with the project team, considering contractual and commercial risks associated with subcontracts; ensure cost, service, and quality requirements were met. To do so, I did rigorous assessment and documentation of subcontract terms and conditions considering technical requirements, specification, bidders' experience, qualifications. I served as a primary point of contact with subcontractors, prepared contracting documentation, and coordinated with other teams. Also, I reviewed bidders' resources, machinery, labor force to ensure the participants have the proper level of resources for current and future needs, assessed and identified the needs for long-term contracts, including specification, acquisition, maintenance, and support requirements. During each bidding process, I analyzed the price proposal to determine the reasonableness of the process, reviewed and interpreted contract provisions to achieve cost efficiencies.  I proviÄ‘e documentation and interpretation of contractual rights and obligations to ensure that due diligence would be practiced in complying with the stated terms and conditions</p>

  <h2>2013 - 2017 Planning Engineer at <img src="asset/picture/GSECic.png"></h2>
  <h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>
    <p>From September 2013 to March 2017, I worked as a Project Engineer at GS E&C Tan Son Nhat - Binh Loi - Outer Ring Road Project office. This project was invested under BT contract(Building-Transfer Contract) to relieve traffic from Truong Son Intersection to Nguyen Thai Son intersection. The total length of the project is 13.6km. The total invested capital of the project is 340 million $US. GS E&C was the general contractor of this project</p>
  <h4>Cost Control <i class="fas fa-hand-holding-usd"></i></h4>
  <p>My roles were to compile monthly reports according to the project standard procedures and carried out site measures with construction teams in accordance with contractual procedures. While assessing the monthly payment requests from the subcontractors, I administered payments to subcontractors by reviewing submissions in term of their contracts, identified if material and works were scope or variation to the budget, ensured control of submitted invoices and tracking of payment both electronically and physically.</p>
  <h4>Project Progress Control <i class="fas fa-tasks"></i></h4>
  <p>I performed project progress control to keep tracking of project completion. Further, I partnered with project management to communicate project progress, ensure timesheets, invoices, monthly reports are approved and sent. The monthly reports I composed helped managers accurately forecast project cost and timeline to ensure the project was achieving expected profit. I also helped to identify conflicts in construction progress and communicate them to the project for resolution. I composed project progress monthly reports to maintain clear communication lines by providing regular project updates, manpower forecast, documentation progress, and reporting on all activities, including immediate reports of urgent issues.</p>
    <p>Within my serviced period, I successfully composed and submitted 36 project progress reports to keep the relevant parties updated with the actual progress</p>
  <h4>Design Change Control <i class="fas fa-exchange-alt"></i></h4>
  <p>Design changes and rework were inevitable in construction projects. The objectives were to analyze the relationship of design changes and the consequent rework to recognize their resulting impacts on project performance, providing insights into the design change proposals. My responsibilities were to review the project's initial design, review the site conditions report to mark the design issues. Next, I prepared sketches of the design concept and composed the design change proposals. The design change proposals were comprised of quantity, cost variation caused by the changes. The design change reports had to be submitted to the related government offices, and my roles were to explain and defend the proposals by gathering test results, site condition reports. For each approved design change, my roles were to update the approved design changes to the project total bill of quantities, keep tracking and control the project quantities, and design changes electronically and physically</p>
  <p>Within my serviced period, I composed 290 different design change proposals related to various structures, including bridges, earthworks, the foundation works, drainage works, etc.</p>
